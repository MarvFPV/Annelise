A PrimeE-Style gasket mounted 3d printable keyboard

!!Warning: Will not fit original PrimeE PCB!!

I have so far only printed one case, still waiting for plate. 
As this is basically an untested keyboard at this point, i have only released the f3z archive file for now. 
Feel free to tinker around, also, enable "component colour cycling", makes the timeline and whole project much nicer to work with.

More progess to this project will hopefully follow shortly.
